   The extension in version |version| is available for TYPO3 v11 LTS, TYPO3 v12
   LTS and TYPO3 v13 LTS, and requires at least PHP 8.1.

The recommended way to install this extension is by using Composer. In your
Composer-based TYPO3 project root, just type::

   composer req brotkrueml/schema-pending

and the recent stable version will be installed.

In a legacy installation, you can also install the extension from the
