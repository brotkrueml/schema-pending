/**
 * A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, of resources. Typically a funder sponsors some MonetaryAmount to an Organization or Person,
 * sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or long-lived Project, resulting in one or more outputs, or fundedItems. For financial sponsorship, indicate the funder of a MonetaryGrant. For non-financial support, indicate sponsor of Grants of resources (e.g. office space).
 *
 * Grants support  activities directed towards some agreed collective goals, often but not always organized as Projects. Long-lived projects are sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also common for a project to be associated with a single grant.
 *
 * The amount of a Grant is represented using amount as a MonetaryAmount.
