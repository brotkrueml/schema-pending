 * A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring Event. At a minimum a schedule will specify repeatFrequency which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
 * This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
 * have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.
